Anonymity is the key to honest communication,

Most people don't appreciate anonymity before they lose it, and you only get to lose it once. Susurri will help you keep it as long as possible. Messages will be encrypted end-to-end using AES, and the login system will make sure no one will be able to access your account.

## About me and the Susurri

Hello, this is "MagicCactus42," though my real name is Michał. I am 19 years old, and this year I graduated from high school and wrote my matura exams. I am also the younger brother of one of the Devmentors, Goorion.

I started working on Susurri during the "100 commitów" competition organized by Devmentors, and it is my first application. I began with virtually no knowledge, but I believe I have made progress and developed a genuine enthusiasm for learning to code.

Unfortunately, I won't be able to deliver all the features I initially outlined for the project; I overestimated my capabilities. However, I will do my best to have the website up and running before the project's deadline, allowing users to at least send messages after logging in. After the "100 commitów" competition concludes, I will continue to develop Susurri, as it has become an enjoyable endeavor for me.

Final thoughts: It is currently 7th of June and, I must unfortunately admit that I wasn't able to deliver all the features, including some of the most crucial ones like AES encryption and logging in using GnuPG keys. The main reason for this is primarily my lack of skills and thorough understanding of ASP.NET core and Blazor. Starting the project as a Blazor Server instead of Blazor WASM has led to issues with correctly implementing JWT, messages not automatically fetching from the database requiring page refresh, and inability to add interactive drawers. Nevertheless, I will deploy this website, and it should be operational by the evening of the 8th of June. 

## What features will it have?

The list of features is not strict, some may be added or removed later in the project.
- AES encryption
- GnuPG login system
- Push notifications
- Intuitive and aesthetic UI
- etc.

## Coming soon
- Graphic visualization of the project
- Tests
- etc.
