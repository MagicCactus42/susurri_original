Anonymity is the key to honest communication,

Most people don't appreciate anonymity before they lose it, and you only get to lose it once. Susurri will help you keep it as long as possible. Messages will be encrypted end-to-end using AES, and the login system will make sure no one will be able to access your account.

## Afterthoughts on Susurri

I’ve made this repository public again. After nearly a year of learning .NET and working on other projects, I can clearly see that this was a big ball of mud. Still, it served as a valuable learning experience, and I'm grateful for the growth it helped me achieve as a developer.

## About me and the Susurri

Hello, this is "MagicCactus42," though my real name is Michał. I am 19 years old, and this year I graduated from high school and wrote my matura exams. I am also the younger brother of one of the Devmentors, Goorion.

I started working on Susurri during the "100 Commits" competition organized by Devmentors, and it is my first application. I began with virtually no knowledge, but I believe I have made progress and developed a genuine enthusiasm for learning to code.

Unfortunately, I won't be able to deliver all the features I initially outlined for the project; I overestimated my capabilities. However, I will do my best to have the website up and running before the project's deadline, allowing users to at least send messages after logging in. After the "100 Commits" competition concludes, I will continue to develop Susurri, as it has become an enjoyable endeavor for me.
