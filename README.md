# Susurri - Messenger web application with E2E encryption

Anonymity is the key to honest communication,

Most people don't appreciate anonymity before they lose it, and you only get to lose it once. Susurri will help you keep it as long as possible. Messages will be encrypted end-to-end using AES, and the login system will make sure no one will be able to access your account. 

## What features will it have?

The list of features is not strict, some may be added or removed later in the project.
- AES encryption
- GnuPG login system
- Push notifications
- Intuitive and aesthetic UI
- etc.

## Other information

- Readme will be updated on an ongoing basis
- This will be my first project ever written
- I am just beginning my journey with programming so I will be learning throughout the entire period of making this app to make it work

## Coming soon
- Graphic visualization of the project
- Tests
- etc.
